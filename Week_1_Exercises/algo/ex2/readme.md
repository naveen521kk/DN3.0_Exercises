### Time Complexity

- **Linear Search**:
  - Best Case: O(1) (when the element is the first item)
  - Average Case: O(n) (where n is the number of elements)
  - Worst Case: O(n) (when the element is the last item or not present)

- **Binary Search**:
  - Best Case: O(1) (when the element is the middle item)
  - Average Case: O(log n) (where n is the number of elements)
  - Worst Case: O(log n) (when the element is not present)

### Suitability

For a platform where the number of products can be large, binary search is generally more suitable due to its efficiency with larger datasets. It allows for much faster searches, which is crucial for maintaining a responsive user experience. However, the products array must be kept sorted, which can be managed by ensuring that new products are inserted in a sorted manner or by periodically sorting the array.
