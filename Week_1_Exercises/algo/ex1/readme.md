# Time Complexity

- **Add Operation**: average time complexity is $O(1)$.

- **Update Operation**: average time complexity is $O(1)$.

- **Delete Operation**: average time complexity is $O(1)$.

### Optimization

- The `HashMap` can be used to store the products in the inventory, where the key is the product ID and the value is the product object.

- The size of the `HashMap` can be limited based on available memory, which can be adjusted based on the number of products in the inventory.

- Thread Safety needs to be handled if the `HashMap` is accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
